# Press The Button

Clicker game that you stack up buttons to try to get highest Amount of buttons that is possible. Inspired through games like Cookie Clicker and when the first time you use a useState hook its a counter which was adapted into what this game is.

## Installation

Through terminal just use 

```bash
npm install
```

## What I learned
To manage multiple useState hooks. Manipulating localstorage and managing different numbers and multilpiers. Dynamic interface that are displayed through JSON objects.A bit of tailwind most is still standard css.
